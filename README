The codetips library provides generic extensibility to code editors in terms of productivity solutions
like code insight, snippets, zen-coding and more. The first version supports codetips for haXe using
libdl.

The Pacu code editor is using libcodetips (commercially available from www.cyblogic.com).

For building libcodetips you need libftl (github.com/unclefrank/libftl).
